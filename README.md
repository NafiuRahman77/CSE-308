# CSE 308: Software Engineering Course

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to various design pattern problems implemented in **Java** as part of the CSE 308 Software Engineering course. The design patterns are organized across three offline folders, each containing multiple problems. 

---

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into three folders, with each folder focusing on specific design patterns.

### Offline-1
This folder contains solutions for:
1. **Builder Pattern** (Problem 1)
   - The Builder Pattern is used to construct complex objects step-by-step.
2. **Factory Pattern** (Problem 2)
   - The Factory Pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

### Offline-2
This folder contains solutions for:
1. **Observer Pattern** (Problem 1)
   - The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
2. **Mediator Pattern** (Problem 2)
   - The Mediator Pattern is used to reduce the complexity of communication between multiple objects by centralizing it in a mediator.
3. **State Pattern** (Problem 3)
   - The State Pattern allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

### Offline-3
This folder contains solutions for:
1. **Adapter Pattern** (Problem 1)
   - The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper interface.
2. **Decorator Pattern** (Problem 2)
   - The Decorator Pattern allows behavior to be added to an object dynamically without modifying its structure.
3. **Composite Pattern** (Problem 3)
   - The Composite Pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NafiuRahman77/CSE-308.git
   cd CSE-308
   ```
2. Navigate to the specific folder (**Offline-1**, **Offline-2**, or **Offline-3**).
3. Compile and run the main.java files for each problem.
   ```bash
   javac main.java
   java main
   ```
